# Inazuma - HTML Template for Corporate and Business

Inazuma is an open-source HTML template created by [Ranyeh](https://www.github.com/ranyeh24). This template is a clone of [Business | Bootstrap 5 Business Template](https://demo.ayroui.com/templates/business-template/) I found on the internet, but without the framework and slight adjustments to the design. It's just personal project for personal portfolio.

## Notes

Here are the steps to set up animations when scrolling:

* Open `main.js` file in `assets/js` folder
* Look for the line of code that controls animations when scrolling in code line number 138 to 147
* Delete the `//` characters in each line of code to be able to run the code
* After that, save the code and run it in your browser

By default, the JavaScript file that is executed is `main.min.js`. This file is a minified version of `main.js`. You can only use one of the files you want to run on your website. If you want to use the minified version, make sure the code changes have also been implemented in the minified version.

You can follow these steps to add animations on scrolling or set it up yourself with another plugins.
